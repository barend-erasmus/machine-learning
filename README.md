# Machine Learning

Machine learning is the sub-field of computer science that, according to Arthur Samuel in 1959, gives "computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."

## The Hidden Layer

The **Hidden Layer** in machine learning can consist of anything but most commonly consist of one or more of the following algoritms.

* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Support Vector Machines
* Naive Bayes
* k-Nearest Neighbors
* K-Means
* Random Forest
* Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms
* Gradient Boost & Adaboost
* Learning Vector Quantization
* Binary Classification
* Linear Classifier
* and more...

Each of the above algoritms have different variations which inlucdes over 70 unique algorithms.

Here is an example of what a **Hidden Layer** could look like.
